            <h3>About This Activity</h3>
                <p> City Running Tours - San Diego
                Choose how far you would like to run, what areas and sight you would like to see and we will customize a run for you. Your running guide will meet you where you are staying to take you on your run.</p>

                <p> We will run at your pace, provide water and bring a camera in case you feel like capturing the moment. Once your run is complete your running guide will return you back where you are staying.</p>

            <h3>More Details</h3>
                <p>The cost of your City Running Tour is dependent on the distance selected and number of runners registered. It is full price for 1 runner and 10% off each additional runner. The discount will be automatically deducted.</p>

                <p>If you are registering for more than one run you will receive $10 off on the 2nd run and $20 off on the 3rd run. Please make sure to select how many runners. For multiple runners the 10% discount per runner will automatically be deducted.</p>
